# 3D Models for FluidGlass Component

This directory should contain the following GLB model files:

- `lens.glb` - Used for the "lens" mode
- `bar.glb` - Used for the "bar" mode  
- `cube.glb` - Used for the "cube" mode

## How to add models:

1. Download or create the GLB model files
2. Place them in this directory (`public/assets/3d/`)
3. The FluidGlass component will automatically load them

## Note:

If the models are not present, the component will show a warning in the console but won't crash. The animation will work once the models are added.
